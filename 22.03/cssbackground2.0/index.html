            <h1>Noooooo!</h1>
            <p>I had more, but you go ahead. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
            <p>Shut up and get to the point! <strong> Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire.</strong> <em> When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</em> If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.</p>
            <h2>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</h2>
            <p>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</li><li>Belligerent and numerous.</li><li>Noooooo!</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</h3>
            <p>Guess again. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Why did you bring us here? Ummm…to eBay? Hello Morbo, how's the family?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I wish! It's a nickel.</li>
                <li>It's toe-tappingly tragic!</li>
                <li>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</li>

            <p>No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>
            <p>A true inspiration for the children. No. We're on the top. I just told you! You've killed me! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Why did you bring us here?</p>
            <p>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</p>
            <p>Why would a robot need to drink? Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.</p>
            <p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</p>
            <p>Guess again. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</p>
            <p>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. You're going to do his laundry? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
            <p>Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. That's not soon enough! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
            <p>Okay, I like a challenge. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. File not found. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
            <p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
            <p>I'll get my kit! Daylight and everything. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Say it in Russian! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</p>
