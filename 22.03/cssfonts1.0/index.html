        <h1>That's not soon enough!</h1>
        <p>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. I love you, buddy! Hey, whatcha watching? Why did you bring us here?</p>
        <p>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Five hours? <strong> Aw, man!</strong> <em> Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</em> I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>
        <h2>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</h2>
        <p>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Can I use the gun? I'm a thing. Hey, whatcha watching?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</li><li>You are the last hope of the universe.</li><li>And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</h3>
        <p>I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tell them I hate them.</li><li>Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!</li><li>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? We don't have a brig. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
        <p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Leela's gonna kill me. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</p>
        <p>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
        <p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</p>
        <p>For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p>
        <p>Also Zoidberg. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p>
        <p>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. But existing is basically all I do! So, how 'bout them Knicks? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</p>
        <p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Look, last night was a mistake.</p>
        <p>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.</p>
        <p>No! The cat shelter's on to me. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</p>
        <p>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!</p>
