        <h1>What kind of a father would I be if I said no?</h1>
        <section>
            <p>I wish! It's a nickel. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</p>

            <p>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. <strong> The alien mothership is in orbit here.</strong> <em> If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards.</em> Checkmate.</p>

        <h2>Professor, make a woman out of me.</h2>
        <p>Why would I want to know that? File not found. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</li><li>Hello Morbo, how's the family?</li><li>Is that a cooking show?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Your best is an idiot!</h3>
        <p>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! How much did you make me? Soon enough. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who am I making this out to?</li><li>Yes! In your face, Gandhi!</li><li>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</p>
        <p>Belligerent and numerous. Why did you bring us here? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
        <p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
        <p>Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.</p>
        <p>And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Bender, quit destroying the universe! I wish! It's a nickel. Bender, you risked your life to save me!</p>
        <p>Pansy. I'm Santa Claus! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Okay, I like a challenge. Tell them I hate them.</p>
        <p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I had more, but you go ahead. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
        <p>With gusto. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p>
        <p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! She also liked to shut up! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</p>
        <p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Belligerent and numerous. Bender, quit destroying the universe! What are their names? I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.</p>
        <p>Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. A true inspiration for the children. Can I use the gun? Yes! In your face, Gandhi!</p>
